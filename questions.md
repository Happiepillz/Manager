### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? 
#### I spent around 20hrs on it

### 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
#### I would say the one of the most useful feature added to Javascript is the use of React Hooks, specifically the 'useState` hook.

### 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
#### Firstly I would I would identify the key problems follow by monitoring the key metrics. Next I would optimize frontend perfomance such as cutting down of images. I recently graduated and not yet encounter performance issue in a production environment.

### 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
#### If I had more time I would like to implement the notifications, to remind users of upcoming deadline.  This would help ensure tasks are completed on time and improve overall efficiency.
